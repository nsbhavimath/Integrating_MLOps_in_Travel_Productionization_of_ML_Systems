# Integrating_MLOps_in_Travel_Productionization_of_ML_Systems
Productionization-of-ML-Systems 🏨 Hybrid Hotel Recommendation System This project is a part of a Travel Capstone Project which implements a Hotel Recommendation System using a hybrid approach combining Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering. The final model is deployed as a Streamlit web application, allowing users to enter their user ID and receive top hotel recommendations.

📁 Dataset Overview The dataset contains real user hotel bookings with the following features:

travelCode: Unique travel transaction ID userCode: Unique identifier for the user name: Hotel name place: Hotel location days: Duration of stay price: Cost per day total: Total cost paid date: Booking date ✅ Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Removed missing or duplicated entries Converted date strings to proper datetime format Normalized textual and numerical values Counted number of unique users and hotels Collaborative Filtering (CF) Used Surprise library's KNNBasic algorithm Treated the total cost as an implicit rating Evaluated with RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) Final model achieved RMSE ≈ 0.97 Content-Based Filtering (CBF) Vectorized hotel names and places using TF-IDF Computed hotel similarity using cosine similarity Identified similar hotels based on user history Hybrid Recommender System Combined CF and CBF with a weighted score Final score = 70% CF prediction + 30% CBF similarity Produced better personalized hotel recommendations Streamlit Web Application Simple UI: Input user ID and get top hotel suggestions Built using streamlit and deployed via ngrok Real-time hotel recommendation system 🚀 How to Run Locally Step 1: Install dependencies pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit pyngrok scikit-surprise Save the README content as a markdown file readme_content = """

👤2. Gender Classification API using BERT This project is part of a larger Travel & Tourism Capstone, and focuses on predicting gender from a person's name using a deep learning model. The final system is accessible via a REST API built with Flask, trained in Google Colab, and deployed using Docker, ngrok, and Jenkins.

🧠 Project Highlights Component Tool/Tech Used Model BERT (bert-base-uncased) Training Google Colab (PyTorch) API Flask REST API Deployment Ngrok + Docker CI/CD Automation Jenkins (with Jenkinsfile) Monitoring Console + Screenshot Logs 📁 Dataset Overview The dataset includes:

name: First name or full name gender: Label (Male or Female) Data Cleaning Steps:

Removed null/duplicate values Normalized genders (lowercased) Label-encoded gender: 0 = Female, 1 = Male 🧪 Model Training Tokenizer: BertTokenizer Model: BertForSequenceClassification Accuracy Achieved: ✅ > 60% Fine-tuned on short name sequences Trained in Google Colab using GPU (if available) 🚀 How to Run This Project (Colab Flow) 1️⃣ Train & Save Model
